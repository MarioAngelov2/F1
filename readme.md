The constructor standings page displays the current rankings of all Formula 1 teams based on their performance throughout the season. Users can view the team name, points earned, and number of wins for each team, and the standings are updated in real-time.

The race schedule page displays a list of upcoming and past races for the current season. Users can view the name of each race, the date and time, and the location. The schedule is also updated in real-time to reflect any changes to the racing calendar.


## Details

This project was built using `JavaScript` and `React`, and it retrieves Formula 1 racing data from the `Ergast Developer API`.

Ergast provides a free-to-use, RESTful API for retrieving a wide variety of motorsport data, including Formula 1 racing results, driver and constructor standings, and more. In this project, we utilized the Ergast API to retrieve real-time data for driver standings, constructor standings, and the race schedule.

In addition, this project also utilizes several third-party libraries to enhance its functionality and user experience. These libraries include:

- Framer Motion
- Material-UI 
- React Router DOM
- React Spinners
